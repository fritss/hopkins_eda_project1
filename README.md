# hopkins_eda_project1
This is the peer-graded assignment of the coursera course exploratory data analysis in week 1.
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository,
a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 
In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”.
The file household_power_consumption.txt contains this data set.
This file is not part of this repo, but can be downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

The R source files plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R generate the files
plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png respectively.

The R source file project1.R generates all four plots.
